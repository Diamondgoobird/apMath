APMath is a mod that does the math whenever you advance towards a tiered achievement and tells you how much you have left.

/apm disable disables the mod entirely
/apm enable enables just saying how many is left
/apm both toggles whether both are displayed or not (you need both to be enabled for it to show)
/apm debug prints what the config reads; mainly used to search for config issues
/apm help gives help
